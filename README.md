# Modern Spring from Scratch

## Introduction
- This repo is a summarization of the concepts taught in [Modern Spring From Scratch - Java Backends by Java Brains](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqq-6Pq4lTTbEXGYZaPRD22cqnlb1wgKL)
- The notes are covered in [NOTES.md](NOTES.md), including most of the examples. However, few examples are to be referred from the code and these are mentioned explicitly in the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md)
- The concepts are also implemented in code whose starter class is `Main` in [Main.java](src/main/java/org/nizz/modernspringgradle/Main.java) - This can be run locally to help visualize the concepts by using the order of logs
